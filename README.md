## UltramarineDragon
# A senior class project by Kayla Narel
This project is a video game entirely written in Java, all of the source code and images used are created by me.
In order to run the game, either
  -download the file contents in RunnableJar
  -download the java files and neccessary resources in the main branch, run UltramarineDragon.java make sure all files are in the same folder
  
TODO: rearrange image resource files into their own folder to have cleaner organization
